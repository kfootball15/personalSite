To Implement:

[] Initial Projects to complete and add
    [] Weather/Shrooms
    [] Train/Commute
        [] Use the hand-drawn comic (with some digital color)
        [] Redo the final frame with animated SVG
    [] 
    [] Bad Soosh

[] Long Term:   
    [] Host Website
    [] Node/Express server to handle project routes

[] TODOS (in order of priority):
    [] Projects/Doodles should be folders with potential for images and javascript and all sorts of custom set ups
    [] "404" page.
    [] favicon
    [] HTML Prefetching
    [] Custom Lazy Loading (with something colorful and well designed)

[] Today


[] How I want this to work:
    []  I want to have the 'Shell' personal project folder be completely seperate from
        the 'projects' folder.
        []  The 'shell' should just have components resposible for managing the different pages (
            if there are more then one)
                []  Homepage, etc
    
    [] Then I want a seperate folder that contains each project with a structure like so:
            <Project>
                index.js
                <assets>
                    xxx.svg
                    xxx.js
                    xxx.scss
                
            [] Each project has an index.js folder that imports all the neccessary image and
                styling assets needed for that specific project, COMPLETELY self contained not
                a drop of code for this project should be outside this Projects folder
            [] The index.js file has to EXPORT a final component in some way so that
                our 'Shell' application can cycle through ALL the projects and render
                them as a big project for the mainProject, and as thumbnails for the 
                rest.
            
    [] How we design the homePage should be easily changeable.
    [] We should be able to SAVE previous versions of the site so that other people
        can still see past iterations
    
    [] Build
        [] Builds shell application
        [****]  Doodles folder should be OUTSIDE of /public PRE-Build, and Build
                into /public
                []  Doodles should be built out from their index.js and exported into 
                    the public folder?
                    [] I guess the Javascript/React bits can probably be built out with the
                        rest of the application, and merely reference .svg files that can
                        be stored in <project> folders in the public directory
